# 👾 STEAM GAME RECOMMENDER SYSTEM 👾 

STEAM game's Recommender system using machine learning approach and a comprehensive dataset of Steam game recommendations. The system explores three primary recommendation techniques: User-Based Collaborative Filtering (UBF), Content-Based Filtering (CBF), and a Hybrid approach. Special attention has been paid to optimizing memory usage, crucial for handling large datasets in environments like Google Colab.

## 🔎 INTRO
Building an effective recommendation system for a vast platform like Steam is challenging due to the sheer volume of games and user interactions. This project aims to demonstrate how different recommendation paradigms can be applied and combined to suggest relevant games to users. The primary goal is to provide personalized recommendations by analyzing user playtimes and game attributes.

## 📁 DATASET
The system utilizes the ["Game Recommendations on Steam"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/antonkozyriev/game-recommendations-on-steam/) dataset by Anton Kozyriev available on Kaggle. This dataset comprises several CSV and JSON files, including:
- `games.csv ` : General information about games (title, release date, platform support, ratings, prices).
- `recommendations.csv`: User reviews and playtime for specific games.
- `users.csv`: Basic user information (number of products owned, number of reviews).
- `games_metadata.json`: Detailed game descriptions and tags.
The recommendations.csv file is particularly large, containing over 41 million entries, which necessitates careful memory management.

## 🧠 RECOMMENDATION ALGORITHMS
1. **User-Based Collaborative Filtering (UBF):**
Recommends games to a user based on what similar users have played and enjoyed. Utilizes `NearestNeighbors` with `cosine` metric on a sparse user-game interaction matrix to find the most similar users. Recommendations are then generated by aggregating playtime from these similar users for games the target user hasn't played yet.
2. **Content-Based Filtering (CBF):**
Recommends games that are similar in content (description and tags) to games a user has liked in the past. Uses `TfidfVectorizer` to convert game titles and tags into numerical feature vectors. `cosine_similarity` is then applied to find games with similar content.
3. **Hybrid Recommendation System:**
Combines UBF and CBF to leverage the strengths of both approaches and mitigate their individual weaknesses.

## 🛠 MEMORY OPTIMIZATION
Given the large size of the recommendations.csv (over 41 million rows), memory efficiency is paramount, especially when running on platforms with limited RAM like Google Colab (typically 12GB). Several strategies have been implemented:
- **`reduce_memory` Function:** Custom function applied immediately after loading each DataFrame to downcast numerical `dtypes` (float64 to float32, int64 to int32) and optimize boolean types, significantly reducing overall memory footprint.
- **Early Data Filtering:** The recommendations DataFrame is filtered early based on hours played.
- **Sparse Matrix (csr_matrix):** For User-Based Collaborative Filtering, a sparse matrix is used to store user-game interactions. This avoids creating a massive pivot table.
- **Explicit Deletion and Garbage Collection:** Large intermediate DataFrames are explicitly deleted using `del` followed by `gc.collect()` to immediately free up memory.
- **Optimized TF-IDF Input:** Game tags are properly joined into strings before being fed to `TfidfVectorizer`, ensuring correct processing and efficient concatenation with titles.
- **Limited Hybrid Iteration:** The hybrid function limits the number of user-based recommended games it processes for content similarity, balancing recommendation quality with computational and memory costs.
